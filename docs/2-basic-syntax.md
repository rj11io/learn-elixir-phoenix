## Basic Syntax and Data Types

Elixirâ€™s syntax is concise and expressive, and understanding its basic data types is essential for writing any program. This forms the foundation for everything else.

Concepts Covered:
- Variables (dynamic, immutable)
- Basic data types: integers, floats, atoms, strings, booleans
- Basic operations (arithmetic, comparison)
- Comments and interpolation

```elixir
# Variables (immutable, no reassignment; use = for pattern matching)
name = "Alice"  # String
age = 25        # Integer
price = 19.99   # Float
:ok             # Atom (constants with a name)
is_active = true # Boolean

# Arithmetic
sum = 5 + 3     # => 8
div_result = div(10, 2) # => 5 (integer division)
rem_result = rem(10, 3) # => 1 (remainder)

# Comparison
5 == 5.0        # => true (value equality)
5 === 5.0       # => false (strict equality, checks type)
5 != 6          # => true

# Strings and Interpolation
greeting = "Hello, #{name}!" # => "Hello, Alice!"
multiline = """
  This is a
  multiline string
"""

# Comments
# This is a single-line comment
```

Tips for Beginners:
- Variables in Elixir are immutable; once bound, their value cannot change (though you can rebind with `=`).
- Atoms (e.g., `:ok`, `:error`) are used widely in Elixir for status codes or keys.
